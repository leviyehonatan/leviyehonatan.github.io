My name is **Yehonatan Levi**, and this is my coding blog.  

Started programming at age of 6 in my neighbour's basement, being away from home at an early age my father bought me a computer, only 4 colours at a time(graphics mode :) but enough to create my dream world inside it.

My interest has been mainly focused on programming languages, tools, computer graphics and physics.

Over the years I have acquired knowledge in different programming languges, operating systems and environments worked for several companies and private clients.
