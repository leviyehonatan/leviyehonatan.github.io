My name is **Yehonatan Levi**, and this is my coding blog.  

Started programming at age of 6 in my neighbour's basement, being away from home at an early age my father bought me a computer, only 4 colours at a time(graphics mode :) but enough to create my dream world inside it.

My interest has been mainly focused on programming languages, tools, computer graphics and physics.

Over the years I have acquired knowledge in different programming languges, operating systems and environments worked for several companies and private 
clients.

Life has taken me to interesting places across the planet requiring me to code at rather less comfortable situations, but when I am looking at code nothing else bothers me, such nirvana comes from the code.

But solving problems is not always easy, and thus i have decided to document some of the obstacles and solutions found on the way. I always wish that at the end of a very difficult road there should come a moment to relax and look at the fruits of the hard work that was done.
